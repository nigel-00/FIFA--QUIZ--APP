# Overview

This is a quiz game android application built using Kotlin, xml, and using Android Studio as an Integrated Development Environment(IDE).
The xml page is mainly for representing the structure, and the layout of the app. The Kotlin file is for the functionality of the app. I was able to
integrate/ bind my xml views with my Kotlin code using the findViewById method. This enabled functionality in the user interface. The quiz app which consists of
various soccer questions has four screens. The first screen is the main screen that allows a user to choose which quiz level they want to play. There are three levels
which are the easy, medium, hard, and these three levels consist the three different screens. In each level option, the user is able to choose an answer by clicking the button with a choice answer and clicking the submit button. The submit button will record the answer and
generates a new question. After the end of available questions, a dialog will pop up with the total score and an option to restart the quiz. The user also has an option 
to go back to the main menu and choose another level of difficulty.

# Purpose

The purpose for creating this quiz was inspired by my love for trivia games. I wanted to imagine and create one of my own. Most importantly I wanted to develop
my knowledge of creating android apps and thought the quiz game was a good place to start.
